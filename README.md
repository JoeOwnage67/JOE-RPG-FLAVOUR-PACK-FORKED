# RPG Adventure Flavour Pack - Fork

If you like my stuff, feel free buy me a coffee (or a beer) at ko-fi.com/joeownage

This is a custom fork of Mr Samuel Streamer's RPG Adventure Flavour Pack. 

I've stripped all of my tweaks out of this mod and you can now find them in my mod Joe's Tweaks

This mod contains only the fantasy flavour elements, plus a few other things that were not my creations:

- Extensive RPG themed rename of literally everything in Rimworld, including Vanilla Psycasts Expanded schools of magic.
- Resource Trees
- Broombug (can be used as a "broom" mount - like a witch)
- Cash Register Medieval Tech Level Patch
- Caster gear Medieval Tech Level Patch
- Stargates = "Arcane Portal" reflavour of Stagates! mod
- Loot books for Medieval Overhaul (lusty saurid maid)
- Wizard Gloves and Boots (Medieval Overhaul required)
- Pondering Orb television reflavour and retexture
- "Circle of the ___" backstories
- Kid arcanium robes
- Arcane trader
- Bag of Holding
